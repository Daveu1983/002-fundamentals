# Coding Tasks

**Note**

Where applicable, try to do the coding tasks with [ping pong pair programming](http://wiki.c2.com/?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern). 

For example, in your pairs, person A could do task 2, observe that the test fails because task 3 has not been completed. 

Person B then implements the code for task 3. 

You then re-run the test and find that it passes.

Then Person B writes the test and code for task 4.

Person A writes the code and implements the function for task 5 and so on and so on.

## 1) Fixing the test

There is currently 1 test - if you run the test `npm run test` you'll notice that it is failing.

Work out how to ensure this test now passes.

**Hint**

The code in the test itself does NOT need changing

## 2) Write the test for a subtract function

Add a new test that will check that the calculator now supports a subtract function.

**Hint**

At this stage the test should FAIL.

## 3) Implement the subtract function

Update your application to implement a new function that will subtract two numbers and return the result.

The test from task 2 should now pass.

## 4) Write a test for a multiply function

Add a new test that will check that the calculator now supports a multiply function.

**Hint**

At this stage the test should FAIL.

## 5) Implement the multiply function

Update your application to implement a new function that will multiply two numbers and return the result.

The test from task 4 should now pass.


# Written questions

The following questions are intended to be answered with written answers (no coding required) and should re-enforce some of the learning you have completed.

1) What might happen if we just created the date as a new date in the wakeup function? (This is a tough one...)
