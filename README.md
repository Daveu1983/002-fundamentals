# Week 1 - Programming Fundamentals

# Conditionals and Loops

## Introduction

Next up on the programming fundamentals section are conditionals and loops. Put plainly, conditionals are choosing whether or not to do something. Loops are doing things multiple times until a conditional is met.

For example counting to 10 seems like a trivial task to us humans. In computer terms you have to loop 10 times and tell the computer to add 1 to the previous number until it reaches 10.

## Technology

We'll continue to make use of the Javascript programming language within a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment and utilising a test framework called [Jest]( https://jestjs.io/en/) to run our code.

## Instructions

The code structure is exactly the same as your [first steps in programming fundamentals](https://github.com/techreturners/001-fundamentals) so all the folders and files should already look familiar.

Instead of a calculator we'll be using our new application called alarm. As you can imagine this thing does alarms, somewhat ironically the alarm is not a "morning person" as the tasks will reveal.

All the running and execution instructions are exactly the same as the previous fundamentals coding tasks. 

**NOTE** Don't forget you will still need to `npm install` because we're in a new application code base.

Head on over to [tasks to get started](./docs/TASKS.md).
